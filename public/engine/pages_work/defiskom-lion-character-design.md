This is a design that I made when I was in high school, using a computer in the student council room at school.

This is the logo of a one-year professional program institution and a picture of a lion, which is a representation of Malang, the city where the professional program is located.

I created this work because I realized it was rather difficult to continue education until college at that time and chose to work alone, but took the course first. majoring in graphic design and computer.
