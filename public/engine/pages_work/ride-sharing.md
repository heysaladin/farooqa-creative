## Define The Challenge


### Ask The Expert (expert, user, developer, merchant etc.)

â‡’ Interview

- Have you ever traveled from one place to another by public transportation?
- If you travel, is it more often alone?
- If traveling alone from point A to point B, automatically the bench is empty right, do you mind when other people hitchhike?


### *What the story*

Often in life we see people who might want to downsize in their lives, including frugality in terms of transportation costs.

On the other hand there are conditions where we order a taxi or similar service where the car that takes us over 2 or more seats and we pay in full for the car even though there are 2 or more empty seats.

There are also conditions when we are traveling using private vehicles, both cars and motorcycles, we have an empty seat filled with nothing.


### *What the problem*

- Number of empty seats in our transportation vehicle
- The high cost for renting a short distance car because one car is only for one person
- Traveling with an empty bench is less economical because the fuel consumed is relatively the same when compared to us filling the empty bench


### *How Might We*

- How Might We help people who need a ride to get a ride
- How Might We make people who have free space on their vehicles to offer a ride service
- How Might We made a solution so that transportation costs could be cheaper with a joint venture
