This is an exploration of logo and business card designs. at that time I was studying design and worked as an operator and graphic designer at a printing press in the city of Malang, East Java.

I was actively studying the print design at the time, about the color of the print, tighten it to the safe distance of the paper area to be cut later. Serus deh.
