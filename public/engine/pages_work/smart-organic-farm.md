## Understand

Increasingly more and more people are starting to worry about the quality of the food they consume, ranging from vegetables, fruit to meat. Food that is produced and processed organically is a pretty attractive choice for many people who are starting to care about the quality of the food.

Good organic food ingredients are those that are allowed to grow and develop with natural conditions without chemical fertilizers and chemical pesticides, even if using fertilizers will use organic fertilizers made from natural materials such as compost and manure.

### Problems

* High demand but the production and availability of organic food ingredients is still limited
* The wrong perception about the production of organic food must be in a broad place
* Harvesting of organic food that is not yet time (far from the life span of plants or animals that live naturally)

### How Might We

* How might we give understanding to people to produce their own healthy food
* How might we give understanding to people to produce healthy food in their respective fields
* How might we help organic farmers or breeders know their age and other data from plants or animals that they maintain
