## Problems

Data obtained:

* In DKI Jakarta at the end of 2018 there were more than 30 thousand cats, not including dogs. This caused the beginning of 2019 the DKI Jakarta government to conduct raids on cats roaming throughout DKI Jakarta
* In Jakarta there were also 19,753 cats that had been given rabies vaccine throughout 2018. This means that there are still many cats in Jakarta that have not been given the vaccine and have the potential to spread rabies to humans.

### Dream Buddy

This is the most unique page on this Petado application. Where if the current animal can be chosen for adoption, the user can make the pet's expectations criteria. Users can specify the size, coat color (body color), type (workers, family, contests etc.) as well as special notes about their dream pet.

This feature makes the user get special notifications if there is new information about animals that might be close to the animal's expected criteria. It is hoped that in this way it will increase the interest of the community to adopt.

Indeed, the best is adoption without being picky, but most people are still picky if they want to adopt abandoned and neglected animals.
