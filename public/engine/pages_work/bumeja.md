Until the end of 2018, the Population and Family Planning Agency (BKKBN) noted that Indonesia's Population Growth Rate (LPP) was at 1.39%, meaning that every year there were 4.2 million to nearly 4.8 million newborn babies in Indonesia.

#### Kasus Stunting

The prevalence (Prevalensi) of stunting for infants under five years old in Indonesia in 2015 is 36.4%. This means that more than one third or around 8.8 million children under five experience nutritional problems where their height is below the standard according to their age.

2. Are you a boy or a girl?
3. What age are you now?
4. Where do you live now?
5. What is your current profession?
6. According to the BKKBN there are around 4 million babies born every year in Indonesia, and from other data there are around 8 million infants stunted, how do you think how to monitor the growth and development of children and the health of pregnant and lactating mothers?
7. Why do we need to know the conditions of growth and development of babies and the health of pregnant and lactating women?
8. Did you already know about the Mother and Child Health Book (Pink Book)?
9. Do you need the Pink Book? Give me the reason too!
10. What do you expect in the Pink Book?

**Link Survey [here](https://saladin129084.typeform.com/to/ZTd2Uj).**

**Insight obtained from the Survey:**

* Many do not know what a pink book is
* No need for a pink book, just browse
* Sheet to be filled by a doctor (medical officer) is limited, will run out if parents diligently check and ask the doctor to record something on the sheet
* There are features that are not available in the pink book, such as recording the baby's head circumference and mother's waist circumference
* There are no detailed records for the condition of the fetus, there are only records of the baby after birth
* It's better if there is a digital version

**Insight obtained from the Interview:**

* It's time to go digital because it's not practical to bring pink books here and there

### Problems

- The book is a mix of information and forms that will be used by doctors and paramedics to note the child's growth and development
- Books in physical form where if books are left at home, they cannot be used
- The book is prone to missing
- Book vulnerable to damage (wet, burned, eaten by termites and other damage)
- Some features aren't in the pink book yet
- Pink book updates are expensive because they need to be printed and distributed throughout the country

## Define

### How Might We

- How can we help working mothers to get the pink book function without the hassle of carrying it, so that the data collection of their children's health records can continue to run
- How can we help working mothers to read and update the contents of a pink book every day without having to bring the book, so that he always remembers the condition of his child even though he did not bring a pink book
- How can we help mothers to access pink books anytime and anywhere including remote areas and without internet signal
- How can we find a solution so that book size is no longer a problem
- How can we help mothers obtain information according to their current conditions (pregnancy, preparation for childbirth, breastfeeding, etc.)
- How can we help mothers take appropriate actions related to what is currently experienced (contractions, breast milk not coming out, thin children and others)
- How can we give notification so that the mother is always attentive and does not forget to give the right actions for her baby

### Pain Points

- There are still many mothers and expectant mothers who don't even know that there is a pink book
- The number of mothers who have pink books but are not enough to be able to maximize the benefits of pink books
- Pink books are not practical in carrying, sometimes can forget to bring the book when consulting
- Pink books are prone to missing / damaged

### Constraint

- Case study ini hanya membahas tentang buku pink dari dinas kesehatan, dan tidak membahas apa-apa yang tidak terkandung dalam isi buku pink
