# Welco Logo Guideline

<p class="meta">Design  /  Monday, February 2, 2015 7:41:06am</p>

This is the guideline brand of the welco logo.

Welco is a company engaged in the processing, packaging and selling of chocolate products.

This brand guideline was made because my team was trusted to redesign the Welco logo.

Brandguideline itself is very important to ensure that the logo used in its application is suitable and does not violate the rules that have been prepared when making the logo.

So, with the brand guideline logo can be applied in a variety of implementations without violating the rules that have been made. So ordinary people can easily distinguish the logo from other logos that may be similar.
