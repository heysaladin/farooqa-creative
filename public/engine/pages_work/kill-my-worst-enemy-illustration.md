# Kill My Worst Enemy Illustration

<p class="meta">Design  /  Thursday, February 28, 2013 11:36:41am</p>

This is a T-shirt design with the concept of "Beautiful but deadly". This is a symbol of "feeling lazy". Feeling lazy is often tempting, but if we are tempted by the temptation, he will be very deadly.

Therefore this concept I gave the title "Kill My Worst Enemy" which literally is "kill my worst enemy" which is "feeling lazy".

Another reference is the word "Kill My Worst Enemy" taken from a fragment of one of the Burgerkill band songs.
