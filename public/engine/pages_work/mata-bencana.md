## Understand

Living in a tropical country and an island like Indonesia, facing and being alert to disasters is something that inevitably has to be faced. Knowledge of a little disaster science is something that should be present in every person who lives and lives in Indonesia.

The government has taken a very good attitude by forming BNPB and BASARNAS. Where the two organizations are the mainstay when disaster strikes. But unfortunately the knowledge and awareness of the Indonesian people towards disaster is still lacking. If you do not believe, try asking your friends, if there is an earthquake, what should be done, if there is a fire, who should contact? Does your current place have the potential for natural disasters such as tsunamis, earthquakes, landslides or floods? I think many people still don't know, so I made this exploration to help the community know information and knowledge about disaster.

### Problems

* Indonesian people still lack knowledge and awareness of disaster science
* Indonesian people still do not know if there is a disaster what to do
* Indonesian people still don't know what to do to prevent disasters (especially disasters caused by human error)
* Indonesian people still do not know what the potential disaster is where he lives
* Indonesian people still do not know about the disaster records of an area

### How Might We

* How might we give a little knowledge about disaster science
* How might we provide information and tips on what to do in the event of a disaster
* How might we provide information on what must be done to prevent disasters (especially disasters caused by human error)
* How might we provide information on what potential disasters there are where he lives
* How might we provide information about a region's disaster records
