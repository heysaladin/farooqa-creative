## Understand

*Exploration Location: Karma Innovation Center (KIC) - Karma Head Office Bali*

A good team is a team that continues to grow. Because there is free time on the sidelines of work, it will be more effective if used to do things that are more useful.

### Define the Problems

The following are some of the problems that exist in the KIC work environment:

* The desire to learn is high but hard to commit
* The need for sharing knowledge but hard to find partners in learning
* Difficult to determine the time to use to learn together
* There is a sense of hesitation between team members
* Ignorance between team members whether the team members invited to learn are busy or not

### How Might We

* How might we create a system where team members can find out whether other team members are busy or not
* How might we make it easier for team members to honestly tell their friends that they are busy or not
* How might we make free time not be wasted because it is used to learn and upgrade skills
