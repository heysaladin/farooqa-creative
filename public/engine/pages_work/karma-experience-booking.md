### Usability Testing (UT)

The purpose of Usability Testing is to find out whether the application created can be used by the user.

Performed UT to 3 participants.

<p class="caption">Usability Testing for Karma Experience Booking | 3rd Participant</p>

The following are excerpts from the usability test. In this Usability Testing, the team recorded using the following tools:
- Macbook Pro 13 "2010 -> recording device
- iPhone 6S -> prototype presenter
- facetime -> record using camera build-in from Macbook Pro
- [letsview] (https://letsview.com/) -> for mirroring the iPhone to Macbook (need to be installed on Macbook and iPhone)
- wifi connection
- quicktime player -> to record all screen activities and record sound using the microphone build-in on a macbook

Some insights obtained from the Usability Testing process:

- Need to find the best way to create an initial trigger to redirect users from the main karmagroup website to the Karma Experience Booking webapp
- Need a better way to display room choices
- Need a better way to show the user that the choice of room affects the price per night stated
- Need more attractive offers or discounts on the front (home)
- List offers like blogs don't look like offers
- Need to consider using sticky headers
- Display card in gold gradation looks like a button

### Scoring

For this assessment, we use the Net Promoter Score and emphasize on 3 aspects of assessment, namely Usefulness, Learnability, and Satisfaction. The NPS formula is -> NPS = Promoters - Detractors. The results are as follows:

**Participant 1**

- Usefulness: 9
- Learnability: 7
- Satisfaction: 7

**Participant 2**

- Usefulness: 10
- Learnability: 8
- Satisfaction: 8

**Participant 3**

- Usefulness: 8
- Learnability: 8
- Satisfaction: 9

. . . 

Then the calculation of the Net Promoter Score is as follows:

**Usefulness**

- Promoters (score 9-10): 2
- Passives (score 7-8): 1
- Detractors (score 0-6): 0

**NPS untuk Usefulness: 2 - 0 = 2** (Two people are willing to support and promote others in terms of Usefulness)

**Learnability**

- Promoters (score 9-10): 0
- Passives (score 7-8): 3
- Detractors (score 0-6): 0

**NPS untuk Usefulness: 0 - 0 = 0** (No one is willing to support and promote to others in terms of Learnability, but also not to speak ill)

**Satisfaction**

- Promoters (score 9-10): 1
- Passives (score 7-8): 2
- Detractors (score 0-6): 0

**NPS untuk Usefulness: 1 - 0 = 1** (One person is willing to support and promote to others in terms of Satisfaction)
