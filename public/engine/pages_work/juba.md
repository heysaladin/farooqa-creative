## WHAT WE DID

Because the team members are just me individually, I decided on do the Rapid Design Sprint and UX / UI Design.

## THE BRIEF

HSBC wants to increase market share in Malaysia, by reimagining their banking solution for children and youths. Their aim is to adopt the younger generation, and grow the relationships into adulthood.

## APPROACH

***Understand (Empathize)***
I begin with the process of understanding how language and the context of communication are carried out by children. We find that children will understand easily with "simple" and "cheerful" language structures.

***Define***
We further define what we can do:
How might we be able to convey to children that the banking process is simple
How might we present an application that looks fun, cheerful and not boring

***Ideation***
We continue the ideation process. Barena in this project I work alone, I do this ideation process myself.

***Information Architecture***
Because in the banking system, accounts and account numbers are very important, therefore I think it needs to be displayed at the beginning.

***Design Style***
Based on our predetermined points of "simple" and "cheerful" we choose to use yellow rather orange because it represents the cheerful and vibrant nature in accordance with children's daily lives. supported by the delivery of simple content that makes it easy for children to use the application that we will develop. Even to support this simple concept, we try to avoid using color gradations and using shadows.

## RESULTS
Within 5 days we were able to create a high fidelity prototype that HSBC can use as a consideration for conducting usability testing. This prototype was made in accordance with the original purpose of reaching out to children and youth customers. With the use of color tones, fonts and simple layouts, it is expected to make it easier for kids users to get acquainted with the main features of a banking service.
