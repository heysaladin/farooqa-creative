## Problem Statement

The loan application process which generally has to go through a complicated process and user limitations to choose which loan application products are suitable for him so that how he manages his loans is our concern.

## Explorations

I decided to follow the Design Sprint methodology in essence. We aim to start with MVP by releasing the most important features first. The aim is to increase the number of people who use our products rather than building more features first.

### *Understand (Empathize & Define)*

From the problems revealed earlier, there are 3 main things that concern us, namely "the process of finding a suitable loan", "the submission process" and "the loan management process".

**How Might We**

* How might we possibly help the search process easier
* How might we make the submission process as simple and as easy as possible
* How might we make it easier for users to manage their loans

**Define the challenge**

* Make the user find the loan product that is most suitable for him
* Simplify the submission process which is generally bureaucratic and complicated
* Make it easy for users to find out their current loan status, which ones are still active, which have been paid off and so on

**Goal**

*"Being the easiest loan product to be used by users throughout Saudi Arabia"*

### *Sketch (Ideate)*
