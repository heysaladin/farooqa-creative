Dining together or having a culinary tour is one of the favorite activities of the common society The main purpose of this dining activity is not only to find delicious food but also a means of gathering with the closest people. But everything has changed since the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

# Understand

## Understand the situation

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the earth since the end of 2019. Hundreds of thousands have been infected and tens of thousands have died because of it. This virus is transmitted through droplets from the respiratory tract and attacks the respiratory organs, especially the lungs so that it can have fatal consequences because it can interfere with breathing. The pandemic has particularly hit the hospitality sector, including restaurants, because visitors are afraid of contracting them while in restaurants.

## Understand the customer

Restaurant consumers not only want to get delicious food but also the best atmosphere and service from the restaurant because experience and service cannot be obtained from food delivery services to eat at home.

## Understand the business owner

The pandemic has hit the restaurant business badly. however, the longer people stay at home, the higher the desire for entertainment services, including restaurant services. COVID-19 is spread through droplets from infected people, these droplets are spread most easily due to interactions with other people. As long as the restaurant can minimize the interaction of customers who come, it should be relatively safer.

## Problem statement

> *How can a restaurant reduce interactions with strangers in the restaurant, waiters and payment processes without physical contact to convince customers that restaurant services can be carried out safely without fear of contracting COVID-19?*

# Research

## User interview

I traced it again by conducting a simple face-to-face interview and not using an online chat application. Interviews were conducted with several questions regarding the need to find out about restaurant services during the pandemic.

## Points of research

- People are tired of staying home too long
- People want vacation or other entertainment
- Payment can be online via ewallet or similar
- The dining table, equipment and others can be cleaned again before and after a customer arrives
