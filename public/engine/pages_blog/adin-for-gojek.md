# Adin for Gojek

<p class="meta">Design  /  Monday, December 16th 2019</p>

As a form of my interest in Gojek, I had some ideas about new features and products for Gojek. These ideas include:

---

## [Go Ride X](https://farooq-agent.web.app/stories/?type=pages_work&content=go-ride-x)

A feature to find out the user experience when using the gojek app and go-ride sub app. This feature is performed directly when the user uses the go-ride service.

## [Go Delivery](https://farooq-agent.web.app/stories/?type=pages_work&content=go-delivery)

Solution for shipping goods to several points in one go.

## [Go Tour](https://farooq-agent.web.app/stories/?type=pages_work&content=go-tour)

The solution for a tour guide service that will take you and accompany you wherever you go.

That is my exploration related to Gojek, indeed everything is still in the process of research but hopefully it can give an idea of my interest in Gojek.
